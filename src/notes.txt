10 -> 00

is

appearance(1, 2)

thus, mu = 10
tau = 01
e = 00


WE HAVE:

1. update pytrino, upload package and document it well

1. two flavor oscillations on a quantum circuit
2. three flavor vacuum oscillations on a quantum circuit
3. three flavor matter oscillations on a quantum circuit


future scope:

pytrino:

1. extend to antineutrino oscillations
2. accelerate using numba/cython - implement in other languages
4. implement all algos efficiently and time them
5. extend pytrino to (3+1) and n neutrinos
6. extend qc to (3+1) and n neutrinos
7. optimize implementations, especially Identities
8. possibly remove numpy dependency over time?
9. implement in other languages (cpp)
